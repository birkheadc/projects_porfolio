# Projects Portfolio (Front End)

This is what used to be the front end for my CRUD application that managed my Projects Portfolio.

After mostly finishing it, I decided to approach my portfolio differently. Now I use a package to store project information in their respective repositories and retrieve it directly. So this front end is no longer needed, and the back end only parses and caches the data from the package.

You can view the package's source code here: https://github.com/birkheadc/github-repo-parser
